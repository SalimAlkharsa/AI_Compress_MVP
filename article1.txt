Fifty years ago this January, an economist named Burton Malkiel published a book calling for an innovation on behalf of the small investor. “What we need,” he wrote, “is a no-load, minimum-management-fee mutual fund that simply buys the hundreds of stocks making up the broad stock-market averages and does no trading from security to security in an attempt to catch the winners.”

Hard as it may be to believe, index investments weren’t readily available to the average saver in those days. But Dr. Malkiel was convinced that active management couldn’t consistently beat passive index investing. And in 1976 Vanguard came out with just the kind of fund he advocated. Today the sum of indexed assets is now in the trillions, and index funds, he reports, “account for more than 40% of the total invested in mutual funds and ETFs.”

Dr. Malkiel, 90 years old, still says index investing beats other approaches, and he has half a century of additional data to bolster his case, which he does in a 50th-anniversary edition of the book to be published in January. By now an investing classic, “A Random Walk Down Wall Street” has been updated to cover the many financial innovations (from exchange-traded funds to Ethereum) since it was first published. The book retains its author’s trademark blend of erudition and wit—and his insistence that markets really are efficient. The Wall Street Journal spoke with Dr. Malkiel about active vs. passive investing, his lifelong penchant for betting, and the contention of critics that indexing could be socially harmful. The conversation was held via Zoom; an edited transcript follows.

WSJ: Burt, your book recounts some of history’s worst investing manias and crashes, suggesting that stock prices are given to mad excesses in both directions. So how can you say the stock market is “efficient”?

R. MALKIEL: What I mean by efficient is that information gets reflected quite rapidly. It doesn’t mean that prices are always right or even sane. The trouble is, nobody knows for sure whether they’re too high or too low. Even in some of the worst bubbles, some very smart people said prices made sense. And when Alan Greenspan made his famous “irrational exuberance” speech in 1996, he was years too early. You’d have been better off ignoring him.
